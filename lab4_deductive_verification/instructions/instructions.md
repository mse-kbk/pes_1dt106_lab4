# Lab 4 - Deductive Verification 

Welcome to lab 4! In this lab you will learn how to perform deductive software verification of C programs with the Frama-C toolkit. 

## Requirements 

In order to work on this lab assignment you need to have a working Frama-C installation. You can follow the installation instructions [here](https://frama-c.com/html/get-frama-c.html). 

If you are working on a Mac, there seems to be a problem with GTK (the GUI framework Frama-C uses). In some cases it helps to install the previous version of Frama-C. To do so just use 

```
opam install frama-c.25.0
``` 

instead of 

```
opam install frama-c 
```

Apparently it may also help to install the new GUI called *Ivette*. Instructions for installing *Ivette* are given on the command line once you have finished installing Frama-C. **We will not use Ivette in this lab, so you do not need to install it if the normal Frama-C installation works**. 

To test if your installation was successful issue the following on a command line: 

``` 
frama-c-gui 
``` 

This should open the GUI for Frama-C.

If you cannot/don't want to install Frama-C, you can use the provided VM, which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OcDTmNcECo-EviS_o-C0n30RKPDMMW_/view?usp=drive_link).
The Linux VM has Frama-C installed. In `/docs/instructions_VM.txt` (in template), you will find brief instructions on how to set up the VM. 


## Template 

You can download the template from Studium. 

## Goal 

This lab is a bit different then the previous ones. In the template, there is a document called **frama_c_tutorial.pdf** under the `/docs` directory. This tutorial will walk you through some of the most important aspects of working with function contracts and using Frama-C to prove them correct. You are supposed to work through this document, and solve the exercises at the end of each section.

In the template there is a folder called `/exercises` that has stub implementations for each exercise.

## Resources 

The main resource for this lab is the provided tutorial. However, you may find these additional documents helpful. All of them are provided in the `/docs` directory in the lab template. 

- Frama-C User Manual 
- ACSL Language Specification 
- Introduction to C program proof with Frama-C and its WP plugin
